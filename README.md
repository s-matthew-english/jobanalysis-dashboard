# JobAnalysis Dashboard

JobAnalysis is a dashboard that allows the user to analyse the skill trends demanded from an data scientist and to search for active job positions in the European Union. It also recommends the learning material for a specific skill.

It is created for the EDSA Dashboard, developed for the Horizon 2020 project European Data Science Academy (EDSA).
